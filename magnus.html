            <h1>Magnus</h1>
            <p>During the summer of 2024, I had the privilege of working alongside expert roboticists at HEBI
                Robotics, where my main project was the creation of Magnus. Magnus is a novel mobile robot
                engineered to climb large ferromagnetic structures with versatility,
                operating autonomously or via remote control depending on structural complexity. It features a 5-DOF
                arm, symmetric around the elbow/middle joint, and actuates magnetic pads at both its base and end
                effector to adhere to surfaces.</p>

            <h1>Hardware Design</h1>
            <p><strong>Magnetic Pads:</strong> Designed magnetic pads that could be mechanically toggled for both
                surface attachment and detachment. The pads needed to securely hold the robot in various kinematic
                and dynamic configurations while remaining light enough for the robot to lift its own weight. Used
                finite element analysis to tackle the challenge of balancing the strength of the pad structure with
                the need for a lightweight design. </p>
            <p><strong>Tether-Free Operation:</strong> Removed the need for a tether by adding a Raspberry Pi and
                battery, allowing the robot to operate without external connections.</p>

            <h1>Software Development</h1>
            <p><strong>Manual Control:</strong> Implemented manual control and determined the appropriate
                spatial frames of reference for mapping joystick controls for the most intuitive user
                experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Stepping Algorithms:</strong> Experimented with various stepping algorithms in MATLAB
                for semi-manual or autonomous movement of the robot.</p>
            <p><strong>Surface Transitions:</strong> Integrated automatic transitions between ground, wall, and
                ceiling surfaces, allowing the robot to navigate complex environments. To complete these
                transitions safely, the robot takes advantage of the torque sensing capabilites of HEBI
                actuators to feel and find the relative slope of perpendicular surfaces.</p>
            <p><strong>Magnus Class:</strong> Encapsulated all previously developed functions into a Magnus class for
                better software modularity and simplicity.
            <p><strong>Autonomous Movement:</strong> Added robot autonomy, enabling Magnus to move to any 2D
                position on a planar surface. These complex movements could be pre-programmed or constucted by the user
                during operation via the UI</p>
            <p><strong>Wireless Control:</strong> In the final stage, ported the software to Python to enable
                wireless control of the robot. The Python script was run on a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu.</p>
