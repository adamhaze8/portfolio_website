                <h1>Magnus</h1>
                <p>During the summer of 2024, I had the priviledge of working alongside world-class roboticists at HEBI
                    Robotics, where my main project was the creation of Magnus. Magnus is a novel mobile robot
                    engineered to climb large ferromagnetic structures with versatility,
                    operating autonomously or via remote control based on structural complexity. It features a 5-DOF
                    arm, symmetric around the elbow/middle joint, and uses magnetic pads at both its base and end
                    effector to adhere to surfaces.</p>

                <h1>Hardware Design</h1>
                <p><strong>Magnetic Pads:</strong> Designed magnetic pads that could be mechanically toggled for both
                    surface attachment and detachment. The pads needed to securely hold the robot in various kinematic
                    and dynamic configurations while remaining light enough for the robot to lift its own weight. One
                    major challenge was balancing the strength of magnetic adhesion with the need for a lightweight
                    design. </p>
                <p><strong>Tether-Free Operation:</strong> Removed the need for a tether by adding a Raspberry Pi and
                    battery, allowing the robot to operate without external connections.</p>

                    <h1>Software Development</h1>
                    <p><strong>Manual Control:</strong> Implemented manual control and determined the appropriate
                        spatial frames of reference for mapping joystick controls for the most intuitive user
                        experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stepping Algorithms:</strong> Experimented with various stepping algorithms in MATLAB
                        for semi-manual or autonomous movement of the robot.</p>
                    <p><strong>Autonomous Movement:</strong> Added robot autonomy, enabling Magnus to move to any 2D
                        position on a planar surface.</p>
                    <p><strong>Surface Transitions:</strong> Integrated automatic transitions between ground, wall, and
                        ceiling surfaces, allowing the robot to navigate complex environments. To complete these
                        transitions safely, the robot takes advantage of the torque sensing capabilites of HEBI
                        actuators to feel and find the relative slope of perpendicular surfaces.</p>

                        wireless control of the robot.</p>
