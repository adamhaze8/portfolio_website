            <h1>Custom Fabrication Machines</h1>
            <p>When I first started out in robotics (in middle school), I didnâ€™t have much money. This meant that I
                always had to choose the budget option for every piece of equipment. This often resulted in receiving
                unreliable hardware that required significant modifications to be usable. Because of this, some of my
                earliest projects involved developing and modifying both additive and subtractive fabrication
                machines.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Dual extrusion functionality </li>
                <li>Touch screen for control</li>
                <li>Designed for compactness</lili>
                <li>Final printer is the result of 3 generations and multiple prototypes of each</li>

            <h1>CNC Router</h1>
            <p>Originally, this router came with motor drivers that could support the amperage for NEMA-17 motors but
                not the larger NEMA-23 motors that the mechanical structure was designed for. Because of this, I decided
                to completely redo the onboard electronics. This involved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Replacing motor drivers</li>
                <li>Adding endstops</li>
                <li>Adding an electrical noise filtration circuit for the endstops to prevent signal interference from
                    the variable frequency drive</li>
                <li>Adding a vacuum system to catch dust</li>
            </ul>
